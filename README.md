# CatDesk

**English** | [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

An open-source tool that lets you use ChatGPT Chat as a local coding agent. No reverse engineering, no API, no Codex, no Work mode. A ChatGPT Plus subscription is enough.

# Disclaimer

This is an independent open-source project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI. We built it as a personal tool and decided to open-source it. Some features are still buggy and may cause unexpected behavior. Use it at your own risk. We are not responsible for any loss caused by this tool. It is strongly recommended to run it inside a VM or container.

# Why CatDesk?

Codex has a very generous weekly quota (reset usage frequently) compared to Antigravity (good at good morning) and Claude Code (RIP 5h quota 💀), that's why we love OpenAI so much.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/codex_2x_usage.png" alt="Codex reset usage frequently🙏" width="700"><br>
  <em>Codex reset usage frequently🙏</em>
</p>

However, the quota runs out very quickly if you work on a large project.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/no_remaining_usage.png" alt="We used up our Codex quota on the first day after it reset" width="700"><br>
  <em>We used up our Codex quota on the first day after it reset</em>
</p>

Then you need to wait another 7 days. What are you going to do for the rest of the week?

Here's the solution: most people with a Plus subscription do not use even 10% of their weekly thinking messages.

**_So why not use your 3,000 weekly messages for coding?_**

That's the idea behind CatDesk! It gives ChatGPT Web tools like `write` and `run_command` to edit files on your computer.

</p>

> [!NOTE]
> Although custom connectors are a valid and normal official feature of ChatGPT Chat mode, which is totally fine to use and will not lead to a ban, I believe OpenAI will eventually kill this kind of tool because of the lack of compute. It will probably:
>
> - Introduce usage limits for custom connectors
> - Merge Chat and Work Mode, with no separate limits anymore
>
> There have been some signs recently. For example, the reasoning time for GPT-5.6 Sol High has been reduced from 102 mins → 25 mins, and GPT-6 Sol/Astra are not being added to Chat mode for Plus users (at least for now). I believe this kind of project will not last long (maybe until the end of 2026?), but I'll try my best to maintain CatDesk in the meantime.

# How does this work?

1. A ChatGPT Plus or above subscription is required.
2. CatDesk runs as a local MCP server on your computer. It has the ability to run commands and edit files, just like Codex.
3. You can connect ChatGPT Web to CatDesk using a Custom Connector, which is a feature available only to Plus and Pro users.
4. Done! Now ChatGPT Web can control your computer and code on it.

In short,

```text
ChatGPT Web + CatDesk
= a stripped-down version of Codex
= OpenClaw without cron and other active utilities
```

We tried this with GPT-5.2 before, and the results were poor. However, **GPT-5.4 Thinking is now really good at tool calling and computer use.** The first time we tried it with GPT-5.4, we were surprised by how well it worked. GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.6 are even smoother, and GPT-5.6 is extremely good at using CatDesk. It's also very fast.

# Differences between ChatGPT Chat + CatDesk, Codex, and the API (let's say Plus plan)

|       | ChatGPT Chat + CatDesk                             | Codex                   | OpenAI API           |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Usage | 3,000 messages/week                                | Generous weekly quota   | Pay as you go        |
| Pros  | Stable, no extra fee, and nearly unlimited\* quota | Stable and no extra fee | Stable               |
| Cons  | Not as smooth as native Codex                      | Runs out very quickly   | Tokens are expensive |

\*Let's say you sleep 6 hours a day and use CatDesk every day. In that case, you can send 3,000 / (24 - 6) / 7 = 23.8 messages per hour. Since thinking and tool calls take time, it is very difficult to use up your weekly 3,000 message limit.

# Who needs this?

- People who used up their Codex quota on the first few days after it reset (us🥺)
- People who are working on web development and crawlers. (CatDesk enables ChatGPT Web to read elements and control your browser tab through chrome-devtools-mcp integration.)

# Quickstart

> [!CAUTION]
> This tool is very powerful and can potentially wipe your whole disk or produce unexpected results.
> Run it inside a VM or container (DevContainer is a good option).
> Treat it like OpenClaw, keep it containerized and isolated.

1. Install CatDesk globally with npm.

   ```bash
   npm i -g catdesk --allow-scripts=catdesk
   ```

2. Run CatDesk.

   ```bash
   catdesk
   ```

   Choose `Control Computer`, `Control Browser`, or `Both`.

   On first launch, enter your **ngrok authtoken** and **static domain** from the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup). CatDesk will save them for future launches.

3. Wait for the TUI to show the MCP Server URL.

4. Open [ChatGPT connector settings](https://chatgpt.com/plugins#settings/Connectors?create-connector=true&redirectAfter=%2Fplugins).

5. In the pop-up window, fill in the connector form:
   - Name: `CatDesk` or any name you like
   - MCP Server URL: the full URL shown in CatDesk TUI
   - Authentication: `None`

6. Click `I understand and want to continue`.

7. Click `Create`, then click `Connect`.

   - Permission defaults to **Allow read actions**. For the smoothest experience, we recommend **Allow all actions** (equivalent to Codex's `--yolo`; use with caution).

8. Add this to your ChatGPT `Custom instructions`:

```text
CatDesk is a coding tool and a custom connector. Always use CatDesk if the user wants to do anything related to file operations. Always call `catdesk_instruction` after `list_resources`, and follow the instructions it contains.
```

9. Start using the connector from ChatGPT Web. Some important tips:

- We recommend letting ChatGPT decide which connector to use automatically. You can manually select the connector using `/` or `@`. This way, ChatGPT can only access the connector you selected, which may improve stability. However, the downside is that `web.search` and `web.open` will be disabled, which means it can't search for the latest information. The `web` tool and a custom connector cannot be used at the same time.

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

- To improve performance and avoid high memory usage, we strongly recommend **opening a new session for every small feature**. CatDesk keeps workspace-local continuity in `.catdesk/session.md`: `project_memory_read` recovers it at the start of project work and `session_resume_update` refreshes it before ending substantive work. Library handoff remains disabled by default and is a separate portability layer for another chat, device, or workspace. Enable it in TUI Settings only when ChatGPT Library Search is available and you want that portable transfer. When enabled, `create_handoff` prepares a `catdesk_handoff_<workspace-name>_<short-id>.md` artifact for persistent Library storage without replacing the local session state. CatDesk prefers `.catdesk/session.md`; Library is searched only when local resume state is absent or the user explicitly requests a transferred handoff. Do not put credentials, tokens, passwords, or other secrets in either form of session context. CatDesk can become extremely laggy after 50+ tool calls.

- If you change MCP-related settings (including the tool mode or enabling/disabling the widget), you will need to start a new chat and refresh CatDesk in [settings](https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Plugins). The most reliable way is to remove CatDesk and reinstall it (steps 2–7).

# Tools

CatDesk has two local tool modes: `multi-tools` exposes 19 tools by default (20 when Library handoff is enabled), and `read-only` exposes 4 tools by default (5 when Library handoff is enabled).

CatDesk's local tools in `multi-tools` mode are:

| Tool                        | Type   | What it does                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `catdesk_instruction`       | Guide  | Returns CatDesk usage instructions and renders Binagotchy                  |
| `project_memory_read`       | Read   | Reads local project/session memory from `.catdesk` without creating files  |
| `project_memory_init`       | Write  | Creates missing local project-memory Markdown files under `.catdesk`       |
| `project_memory_update`     | Write  | Appends to or overwrites a dedicated local memory document                 |
| `session_resume_update`     | Write  | Refreshes `.catdesk/session.md` with structured resume state and Git facts |
| `read`                      | Read   | Reads one or more text files from the workspace                            |
| `search_text`               | Read   | Searches workspace text with `rg`, `grep`, or built-in search              |
| `write`                     | Write  | Creates or overwrites a file                                               |
| `edit`                      | Write  | Applies guarded replace/range edits atomically                             |
| `create_handoff`            | Read   | Optional: prepares a workspace-specific Library handoff without changing the workspace |
| `delete`                    | Write  | Previews and confirms deletion of a file or directory                      |
| `run_command`               | Shell  | Runs a short shell command and waits for completion                        |
| `start_command`             | Job    | Starts a long-running shell command and immediately returns a job ID       |
| `poll_command`              | Job    | Reads incremental output and status from a background command              |
| `cancel_command`            | Job    | Stops a background command and its child process tree                      |
| `verify_project`            | Verify | Detects and runs configured Rust, Node, and Python project checks          |
| `git_status_summary`        | Git    | Summarizes Git status and warns on `main`/`master`                         |
| `git_diff_summary`          | Git    | Summarizes staged, unstaged, untracked, deleted, and renamed files         |
| `git_create_feature_branch` | Git    | Creates and switches to a validated feature branch                         |
| `git_commit_verified`       | Git    | Verifies, previews, and commits an explicit file set with confirmation     |

Long-running commands are deliberately decoupled from the lifetime of an MCP HTTP request. Builds, compilation, dependency installation, long test suites, and development servers should use `start_command`, then `poll_command` with the returned cursor. Poll responses are bounded; if `hasMoreOutput` is true, keep polling with `nextCursor` even after the command reaches a terminal state to drain the remaining buffered output. `run_command` remains the simpler path for short commands and has a 120-second maximum timeout.

`verify_project` runs only CatDesk-detected standard checks. A `PARTIAL` result means verification is incomplete, for example because a required executable is missing; it is not treated as a pass. `git_commit_verified` requires an explicit file list and a dry-run confirmation token. Its dry run stages exactly the requested files; the final commit call requires that staged preview to remain unchanged and does not restage files.

If browser mode is enabled, CatDesk can also expose extra browser/devtools tools. Those are provided by the browser bridge, so the exact list depends on your environment.

`search_text` uses `rg` when it is available, falls back to `grep`, then falls back to CatDesk's built-in scanner. Installing ripgrep is optional, but gives the best search performance and behavior.

# Context window

According to [the blog](<https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11909943-gpt-53-and-gpt-54-in-chatgpt#:~:text=Thinking%20(GPT%E2%80%915.4%20Thinking)>) and [the code](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/models-manager/src/model_info.rs#L85), the context window in ChatGPT web is different from Codex.

| Tier | CatDesk + ChatGPT Web (in + out = sum) | Codex CLI (sum)        |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Plus | 128K + 128K = 256K                     | 258K (1M experimental) |
| Pro  | 272K + 128K = 400K                     | 258K (1M experimental) |

Yes. Open [Advanced connector settings](https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Connectors/Advanced) and turn on `Enforce CSP in developer mode`. That setting removes the red button. CatDesk automatically adds the current ngrok domain to the widget CSP, so the widget should keep working with CSP enforcement enabled.

## Already connected. Why does it ask to connect again and again?

There doesn't seem to be any obvious pattern for when the connector triggers `Connect`. We're sure it's not triggered by the tool call count, but we don't know the exact reason.

<table align="center">
  <tr>

Looks like it was a bug, and they fixed it 🥳.

## Can CatDesk be used in other apps?

Yes, in theory. CatDesk may also work with other apps that support custom remote MCP servers, including Claude. (We don't think anyone will use CatDesk with Claude though, since Claude Chat mode and Claude Code share the same usage limits.)

However, CatDesk is built specifically for ChatGPT Chat and its Custom Connector (They renamed it to _Apps_, and now they renamed it again and call it _Plugins_, but to prevent confusion with _Application_, we still prefer to call it _Connector_) flow. ChatGPT Chat is the environment CatDesk is designed and tested for, so other apps may not work as smoothly.

## How does the input/output token be calculated?

CatDesk does not get official token usage numbers from ChatGPT Web. It estimates them locally with `o200k_base`, the same tokenizer family used by GPT-5.5-style models, so the numbers are useful, but still only estimates.

| Field          | Symbol | What it means                | Price                         |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `inputTokens`  | `↓`    | Tool input ≈ LLM output      | ≈ `$30.00 / 1M` output tokens |
| `outputTokens` | `↑`    | Tool output ≈ LLM input      | ≈ `$5.00 / 1M` input tokens   |
| `totalTokens`  | `Σ`    | `inputTokens + outputTokens` | `input price + output price`  |

CatDesk does not count:

- the full ChatGPT conversation
- hidden prompts or reasoning tokens
- other internal tokens on OpenAI's side

The loading animation is only a visual effect. ChatGPT Web does not stream partial MCP tool input/output into CatDesk, so the widget animates locally first and then locks to the estimated values when the real tool result arrives.

## What is workspace?

Workspace is the root directory CatDesk is allowed to work in.

By default, it is the directory where you launch CatDesk. You can also override it with `WORKSPACE_ROOT`.

File tools use this directory as their base path, and paths outside the workspace are rejected.

## Where should AGENTS.md go?

You can put it in 3 places.

1. Workspace root
2. `~/.catdesk/AGENTS.md`
3. `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`

CatDesk checks these locations for `AGENTS.md` in this order. This happens every time `catdesk_instruction` is called. You can also manually choose which `AGENTS.md` to use.

  <em>Set AGENTS.md manually</em>

## What to do if the widget is blank?

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/blank_widget.png" alt="Empty widget/function call" width="500"><br>
  <em>Empty widget/function call</em>
</p>

1. Simply refresh the page and reconnect the connector.
2. Stop the response and send the message again.

This is a bug on ChatGPT's side. There is nothing we can do about it, and changing the code will not solve the issue. This bug was probably introduced on Apr 15th.

# Safety

> [!CAUTION]
> Do **NOT** share the `MCP Server URL` with anyone. Anyone with the URL can access your computer.

The URL is made of these parts:

| Part         | Example                       | What it means                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Public URL   | `https://xxxx.ngrok-free.dev` | Your ngrok static domain                     |
| Random path  | `/Ab3kL9xQ2pTm7VhC`           | A random path generated on first launch      |
| MCP endpoint | `/mcp`                        | The actual MCP endpoint                      |

So the full URL looks like this:

```text
https://xxxx.ngrok-free.dev/Ab3kL9xQ2pTm7VhC/mcp
```

Both the static domain and the random path are persisted in `~/.catdesk/config.toml`, so the full MCP URL stays the same across launches. You only need to set up the connector once.

# About Binagotchy

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/binagotchy.gif" alt="Binagotchy!" width="500"><br>
  <em>Binagotchy!</em>
</p>

The character is a cute shark-cat! We actually made this before CatDesk and decided to put it in the project.

By default, CatDesk will generate a random Binagotchy every time you start it. If you see a cute one, you can set it as your partner on the launch screen. The system will also automatically save every Binagotchy in `~/.catdesk/binagotchy`. You can download it too (or, to be accurate, export it)! Both `.png` and `.gif` are supported. Feel free to use it anywhere. This project and Binagotchy are both under the MIT License. By the way, Binagotchy is generated using pure scripts and does not use any text-to-image or diffusion model.
